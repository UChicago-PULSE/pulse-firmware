# pulse-firmware

This is the central repository for PULSE-A firmware development.

### File Structure
The OBC and PC folders contain the main file for the OBC and PC Teensy boards. However, we are currently testing individual components and features and this code can be found in the `testfiles` folder, which is organized by module.
